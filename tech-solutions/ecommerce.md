# Shopify
You do not develop, you just click it togather. Everything is done by shopify: emailing, payments, order management etc.

For one user shop it is 27Eur per month but next tier with 5 users is 80. Additionally for EVERY transaction you pay shopify ca 2.5%

# Wordpress
For eCommerce you need WooCommerce(free plugin) plugin. But you have to pay for other things like mailing. 
All in all it is cheaper with wordpress.
