# Shopify
You do not develop, you just click it togather. Everything is done by shopify: emailing, payments, order management etc.

For one user shop it is 27Eur per month but next tier with 5 users is 80. Additionally for EVERY transaction you pay shopify ca 2.5% depending on a plan.

# Wordpress
For eCommerce you need WooCommerce(free plugin) plugin. But you have to pay for other things like mailing, hosting etc. 
All in all it is cheaper with wordpress.

You want wordpress.org. Here you can do whatever you want.

## Installation locally
