# Rules of Engagement (ROE)
Before you start pentest, decide with the client on ROE.
1. Permission: This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.
2. Scope: This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.
3. Rules: the rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay.

# Engagement Stages
1. Information Gathering: This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research.
Note: This does not involve scanning any systems.
2. Enumeration/Scanning: This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.
3.Â Exploitation: This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.
4. Privilege Escalation: Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).
5. Post-exploitation: 
This stage involves a few sub-stages:
5.1. What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)
5.2. What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user
5.3. Covering your tracks
5.4. Reporting

# Frameworks
For web applications the most suitable is OWASP

# Scopes
1. Black-Box Testing: tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service.
2. Grey-Box Testing: most popular for pentesting. The tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software. Still, it will be interacting with the application as if it were a black-box scenario and then using their knowledge of the application to try and resolve issues as they find them.
3. White-Box Testing: tester has the full knowledge of system adn code.

# Report
In the end of engagement, tester makes a report where documents what was done, what was found and how to avoid it.


# CIA triad
CIA is information security model. There are three components and all of them must be secured to guard the data.
## Confidentiality
protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse
## Integrity
information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made
## Availability
data must be available and acessible by the user.
